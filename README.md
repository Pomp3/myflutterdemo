=======================

access sklearn (scikit-learn) machine learning library via command line.

Introduction
------------
### What is sklearn?
__sklearn__ is a python machine learning library comprised of various
machine learning algorithms. See [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for detail.

### Why command line?
Although you can write a python script every time you like to use functionalities
provided by sklearn, it is still annoying to write duplicated script again and again.
It is both error prone and inefficient, especially when you want to perform comparisons
on different learning algorithms.
